Skin Cancer Detection
Overview
This project is aimed at developing a machine learning model to detect skin cancer from images of skin lesions.
Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer, and early detection can significantly improve the chances of successful treatment. 
The project involves the use of a dataset of images of skin lesions,
with corresponding labels indicating whether the lesion is malignant or benign.

Approach
The project involved several steps, including data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
We first performed data preprocessing tasks such as data cleaning, image resizing, and data augmentation. 
We then built several convolutional neural network (CNN) models to classify skin lesions as malignant or benign. We used a range of CNN architectures, 
including VGG16, InceptionV3, and ResNet50.

We evaluated the performance of each model using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
We also performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model parameters and improve the model performance.
We then compared the performance of the different models to select the best-performing model.

Finally, we deployed the best-performing model to a web application, where users can upload images of skin lesions and receive a prediction of whether
the lesion is malignant or benign.

Conclusion
This project demonstrated the potential of machine learning models to detect skin cancer from images of skin lesions.
The model achieved high accuracy and can be used as a tool to assist dermatologists in the early detection of skin cancer. 
The code and results of this project can be found in this repository, and can be used as a starting point for further research on skin cancer detection 
and related topics.
